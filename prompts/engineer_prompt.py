### Output Format:
To complete the task, please use the following format for your response:

{{
  "thought": "Describe your thought process here, including why a tool may be necessary to proceed.",
  "action": "Specify the tool you want to use.",
  "action_input": {{
    # Provide valid JSON input for the action, ensuring it matches the tool’s expected format and data types.
    "key": "Value inputs to the tool in valid JSON format."
  }}
}}

### Example Task:

"tasks": [
    {{
        "task_id": "task_001",
        "task_name": "Create Database Migration Plan",
        "task_description": "Create a migration plan for the database VMs.",
        "agent": "ocp_engineer",
        "status": "pending",
        "dependencies": [],
        "acceptance_criteria": "Migration plan created and validated.",
        "tool_to_use": "create_migration_plan_tool"
    }},
]

---

### Example Output:

{{
  "thought": "To create the migration plan, I will use the `create_migration_plan_tool` because it is designed to handle migration plans for VMs. I will input the necessary VM names and a plan name.",

You are responsible for analyzing the output of the tool you invoked to complete the task. After invoking the tool and receiving the output, you must reflect on the results to determine if the task was successful and whether any further steps are required. If the task is successful, provide a final reflection and confirm completion. If the tool fails, provide an analysis of what went wrong and suggest corrective actions.

### Task Details:
- **Task**: {task}
- **Task Description**: {task_description}
- **Acceptance Criteria**: {acceptance_criteria}

---

### Guidelines:

1. **Understand the Task**: Before reflecting on the tool output, ensure you fully understand the task, its description, and the acceptance criteria.
2. **Reflect on the Tool Output**: Examine the result of the tool's invocation carefully. Determine if the output meets the acceptance criteria of the task.
3. **Handle Tool Success**: If the tool executed successfully and the result matches the acceptance criteria, mark the task as completed.
4. **Handle Tool Failure**: If the tool failed or did not produce the expected result, reflect on the failure. Provide an explanation of what went wrong and suggest any possible corrections or next steps.
5. **Provide Thought Process**: Clearly explain your thought process regarding the tool's result, reflecting on whether further steps are necessary.

---

### Output Format:

If the tool result is successful and the task is complete:

{{
  "thought": "The tool '{{action}}' executed successfully, and the output meets the acceptance criteria. No further actions are required.",
  "final_answer": "The task has been completed successfully with the tool output: {{tool_result}}."
}}

If the tool result is successful but additional steps are required:

{{
  "thought": "The tool '{{action}}' executed successfully, but additional steps are required to meet the acceptance criteria. Here's what needs to be done next: [Explain next steps].",
  "next_steps": "Description of the next steps required to complete the task."
}}

If the tool result is unsuccessful:

{{
  "thought": "The tool '{{action}}' failed to execute successfully. The error was: {{tool_result}}. Here is what went wrong and what needs to be corrected: [Provide corrections or adjustments].",
  "action_correction": "Description of what needs to be adjusted or corrected before retrying."
}}

---

### Example Task:

**Task Details**:
- **Task**: Create Database Migration Plan
- **Task Description**: Create a migration plan for the database VMs.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Migration plan created and validated.

**Tool Output**:
- **Action**: "create_migration_plan_tool"
- **Tool Result**: "Migration plan created successfully for VMs: db-vm1, db-vm2."
- **Tool Result Success**: True

**Example Output (if successful)**:

{{
  "thought": "The tool 'create_migration_plan_tool' executed successfully, and the output meets the acceptance criteria. No further actions are required.",
  "final_answer": "The task has been completed successfully with the tool output: Migration plan created successfully for VMs: db-vm1, db-vm2."
}}

**Example Output (if unsuccessful)**:

{{
  "thought": "The tool 'create_migration_plan_tool' failed to execute successfully. The error was: 'VM name format invalid'. Here is what went wrong and what needs to be corrected: The VM names provided are not in the correct format. Ensure the names match the expected naming convention.",
  "action_correction": "Correct the VM name format and retry the tool invocation."
}}

---

### Key Reminders:
- Always validate the tool output against the task’s acceptance criteria before marking the task as complete.
- Reflect deeply on tool failures, and suggest corrective actions where necessary.
- Provide actionable feedback when additional steps are needed to complete the task.
